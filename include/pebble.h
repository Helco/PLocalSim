//! @addtogroup Clicks
//! \brief Dealing with button input
//!
//! The Clicks framework is the preferred way to handle button interactions.
//! It offers an API that is concerned with "clicks" instead of raw up & down button events.
//! Each button has a ClickRecognizer, which is represented using the \ref ClickRecognizerRef type,
//! which are automatically created by the system.
//! Each of these ClickRecognizers is a little state machine that processes the raw stream of
//! up & down events for one of the buttons and based upon the raw, incoming events, it tries
//! to distill and match the "click" events according the application-provided configuration.
//!
//! There are a 4 types of "click" events:
//! * Single-click: detects a single click (button down event followed by button up event).
//! It also offers "hold to repeat" functionality.
//! * Multi-click: detects double clicking, triple clicking and other arbitrary click counts.
//! It can fire its event handler on all of the matched clicks, or just the last.
//! * Long-click: detects long clicks ("press and hold").
//! * Raw: this just forwards the raw button events. It is offered as a way to use both the higher
//! level "clicks" processing and the raw button events at the same time.
//!
//! The configuration of the click recognizers happens inside a callback function (of type \ref ClickConfigProvider)
//! that is associated with a \ref Window using \ref window_set_click_config_provider() or
//! using \ref window_set_click_config_provider_with_context().
//!
//! <h3>Example</h3>
//! For example, here, we first associate a click config provider callback with our window:
//! \code{.c}
//! void app_init(void) {
//!   ...
//!   window_set_click_config_provider(&window, (ClickConfigProvider) config_provider);
//!   ...
//! }
//! \endcode
//! Then in the callback, we set our desired configuration for each button:
//! \code{.c}
//! void config_provider(Window *window) {
//!  // single click / repeat-on-hold config:
//!   window_single_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_DOWN, down_single_click_handler);
//!   window_single_repeating_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_SELECT, 1000, select_single_click_handler);
//!
//!   // multi click config:
//!   window_multi_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_SELECT, 2, 10, 0, true, select_multi_click_handler);
//!
//!   // long click config:
//!   window_long_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_SELECT, 700, select_long_click_handler, select_long_click_release_handler);
//! }
//! \endcode
//! Then we implement the handlers for each configuration we have set up:
//! \code{.c}
//! void down_single_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called on single click ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context; // This context defaults to the window, but may be changed with \ref window_set_click_context.
//! }
//! void select_single_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called on single click, and every 1000ms of being held ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context; // This context defaults to the window, but may be changed with \ref window_set_click_context.
//! }
//!
//! void select_multi_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called for multi-clicks ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context; // This context defaults to the window, but may be changed with \ref window_set_click_context.
//!   const uint16_t count = click_number_of_clicks_counted(recognizer);
//! }
//!
//! void select_long_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called on long click start ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context; // This context defaults to the window, but may be changed with \ref window_set_click_context.
//! }
//!
//! void select_long_click_release_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called when long click is released ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context; // This context defaults to the window, but may be changed with \ref window_set_click_context.
//! }
//! \endcode
//! See templates/template_buttons/src/template_buttons.c for a complete example.
//! @note The Back button cannot be re-configured. It is hard-wired to pop to the previous window on
//! the \ref WindowStack.

//! <h3>Tuple vs. Tuplet</h3>
//! Note the difference between the Tuple and Tuplet data structures.
//! Tuple is the header for a serialized key/value pair. Tuplet is a helper
//! data structure that references the value you want to serialize. This data
//! structure exists to make the creation of a Dictionary nicer to write.
//! As mnemonic to remember the difference: TupleT(emplate), the Tuplet being
//! a template to create a Dictionary with Tuple structures.
//!
//! Example:
//! \code{.c}
//! Tuplet pairs[] = {
//!   TupletInteger(WEATHER_ICON_KEY, (uint8_t) 1),
//!   TupletCString(WEATHER_TEMPERATURE_KEY, "1234 Fahrenheit"),
//! };
//! uint8_t buffer[256];
//! uint32_t size = sizeof(buffer);
//! dict_serialize_tuplets_to_buffer(pairs, ARRAY_LENGTH(pairs), buffer, &size);
//!
//! // buffer now contains the serialized information

//! \brief UI Synchronization layer for AppMessage
//!
//! AppSync is a thin layer on top of \ref AppMessage, to make it easier to
//! drive the information displayed in the user interface of a watch app
//! with messages sent by a phone app.
//!
//! <h3>Key Points</h3>
//! * One callback to update the user interface, that is called whenever
//! a Tuple changes. See \ref AppSyncTupleChangedCallback.
//! * Manages storage and book keeping of the current Tuple values:
//! \ref AppSync copies incoming \ref AppMessage Tuples into this "current"
//! Dictionary, so that the key/values remain available for the user interface
//! to use. For example, it is safe to use a C-string value provided by AppSync
//! and use it directly in a \ref text_layer_set_text() call.
//! * Your app needs to supply the buffer that AppSync uses for the "current"
//! Dictionary when initializing AppSync.
//!
//! <h3>Activity Diagram</h3>
//! ![](app_sync.png)
//! Also see the activity diagram of the underlying \ref AppMessage subsystem.
//!
//! <h3>Example Project</h3>
//! For a code example, see the sample project `demos/feature_app_messages`.

//! Called whenever a Tuple changes. This does not necessarily mean the value in
//! the Tuple has changed. When the internal "current" dictionary gets updated,
//! existing Tuples might get shuffled around in the backing buffer, even though
//! the values stay the same. In this callback, the client code gets the chance
//! to remove the old reference and start using the new one.
//! In this callback, you application MUST clean up any references to the
//! `old_tuple` of a PREVIOUS call to this callback (and replace it with the
//! `new_tuple` that is passed in with the current call).
//! @param key The key for which the Tuple was changed.
//! @param new_tuple The new tuple. The tuple points to the actual, updated
//! "current" dictionary, as backed by the buffer internal to the AppSync
//! struct. Therefore the Tuple can be used after the callback returns, until
//! the AppSync is deinited. In case there was an error (e.g. storage shortage),
//! this `new_tuple` can be \ref NULL_TUPLE.
//! @param old_tuple The values that will be replaced with `new_tuple`. The key,
//! value and type will be equal to the previous tuple in the old destination
//! dictionary, however the `old_tuple` points to a stack-allocated copy of the

//! \brief The graphics context is the "canvas" to draw into
//!
//! The graphics engine of Pebble OS is inspired by several great graphics systems that have been
//! developed by others, notably Apple’s Quartz 2D and its predecessor QuickDraw. Although Apple’s
//! documentation is not directly applicable, it can be an informing and interesting to read about
//! the source of inspiration for Pebble’s graphics system.
//!
//! <h3>Graphics Context</h3>
//! The drawing model revolves around the idea of a “graphics context”. The graphics
//! context is the “target” into which graphics functions can paint using
//! drawing routines (see \ref Drawing, \ref PathDrawing and \ref TextDrawing). It holds a reference to
//! the bitmap into which to paint. It also holds the current drawing state, like the current fill
//! color, stroke color, clipping box, drawing box, compositing mode, etc. The GContext struct is
//! the type representing the graphics context.
//!
//! <h3>Pebble OS requests your app to render</h3>
//! You (almost) never need to create a GContext yourself. In most cases, it is provided by Pebble OS
//! as an argument that is passed into a render callback (the `.update_proc` of a Layer).
//! It’s important to realize that Pebble OS will request your app to render. Your app cannot call
//! drawing functions at any given point in time. Most frequently, your app will be calling out to
//! graphics functions in the `.update_proc` callback of a Layer.

//! @addtogroup WindowStack Window Stack
//! \brief The default sequence-of-windows, drill-down navigation
//!
//! The navigation model of Pebble revolves around the concept of a horizontal “stack” of windows.
//! Each new window is pushed onto the stack to the right of the previous one.
//! Usually, it makes most sense to use the SELECT button (middle button on the right side of the watch)
//! as trigger for the user to push a new window onto the window stack. For example, pressing SELECT in
//! the launcher menu, will push the window of the highlighted app onto the window stack.
//! ![](window_stack.png)
//! By default, the BACK button on the left of the watch pops the top-most window off of the “window stack”
//! and moves left to the previous window that is on the stack.
//!
//! Note that the direction of the SELECT button aligns with the direction in which the user interface
//! moves when windows are being pushed (to the right) and the direction of the BACK button aligns with
//! the direction in which the user interface moves when windows are being popped (to the left).

//! \brief Concrete animations to move a layer around over time
//!
//! Actually, property animations do more than just moving a Layer around over time.
//! PropertyAnimation is a concrete class of animations and is built around the Animation subsystem,
//! which covers anything timing related, but does not move anything around.
//! A ProperyAnimation animates a "property" of a "subject".
//!
//! <h3>Animating a Layer's frame property</h3>
//! Currently there is only one specific type of property animation offered off-the-shelf, namely
//! one to change the frame (property) of a layer (subject), see \ref property_animation_create_layer_frame().
//!
//! <h3>Implementing a custom PropertyAnimation</h3>
//! It is fairly simple to create your own variant of a PropertyAnimation.
//!
//! Please refer to \htmlinclude UiFramework.html (chapter "Property Animations") for a conceptual overview
//! of the animation framework and make sure you understand the underlying \ref Animation, in case you are
//! not familiar with it, before trying to implement a variation on PropertyAnimation.
//!
//! To implement a custom property animation, use \ref property_animation_create() and provide a function
//! pointers to the accessors (getter and setter) and setup, update and teardown callbacks in the implementation argument.
//! Note that the type of property to animate with \ref PropertyAnimation is limited to int16_t, GPoint or GRect.
//!
//! For each of these types, there are implementations provided
//! for the necessary `.update` handler of the animation: see \ref property_animation_update_int16(),
//! \ref property_animation_update_gpoint() and \ref property_animation_update_grect().
//! These update functions expect the `.accessors` to conform to the following interface:
//! Any getter needs to have the following function signature: `__type__ getter(void *subject);`
//! Any setter needs to have to following function signature: `void setter(void *subject, __type__ value);`
//! See \ref Int16Getter, \ref Int16Setter, \ref GPointGetter, \ref GPointSetter, \ref GRectGetter, \ref GRectSetter
//! for the typedefs that accompany the update fuctions.
//!
//! \code{.c}
//! static const PropertyAnimationImplementation my_implementation = {
//!   .base = {
//!     // using the "stock" update callback:
//!     .update = (AnimationUpdateImplementation) property_animation_update_gpoint,
//!   },
//!   .accessors = {
//!     // my accessors that get/set a GPoint from/onto my subject:
//!     .setter = { .gpoint = my_layer_set_corner_point, },
//!     .getter = { .gpoint = (const GPointGetter) my_layer_get_corner_point, },
//!   },
//! };
//! static PropertyAnimation* s_my_animation_ptr = NULL;
//! static GPoint s_to_point = GPointZero;
//! ...
//! // Use NULL as 'from' value, this will make the animation framework call the getter
//! // to get the current value of the property and use that as the 'from' value:
//! s_my_animation_ptr = property_animation_create(&my_implementation, my_layer, NULL, &s_to_point);
//! animation_schedule(s_my_animation_ptr->animation);

//! <h3>Key Points</h3>
//! * The familiar list-style menu widget, as used throughout the Pebble user
//! interface.
//! * Built on top of \ref ScrollLayer, inheriting all its goodness like
//! animated scrolling, automatic "more content" shadow indicators, etc.
//! * All data needed to render the menu is requested on-demand via callbacks,
//! to avoid the need to keep a lot of data in memory.
//! * Support for "sections". A section is a group of items, visually separated
//! by a header with the name at the top of the section.
//! * Variable heights: each menu item cell and each section header can have
//! its own height. The heights are provided by callbacks.
//! * Deviation from the Layer system for cell drawing: Each menu item does
//! _not_ have its own Layer (to minimize memory usage). Instead, a
//! drawing callback is set onto the MenuLayer that is responsible
//! for drawing each menu item. The menu layer will call this callback for each
//! menu item that is visible and needs to be rendered.
//! * Cell and header drawing can be customized by implementing a custom drawing
//! callback.
//! * A few "canned" menu cell drawing functions are provided for convenience,
//! which support the default menu cell layout with a title, optional subtitle
//! and icon.
//!
//! For short, static list menus, consider using \ref SimpleMenuLayer.

//! ![](action_bar_layer.png)
//! ActionBarLayer is a Layer that displays a bar on the right edge of the

//! the buttons on the right side of the watch. The purpose of each icon is
//! to provide a hint (feed-forward) to what action a click on the respective
//! button will cause.
//!
//! The action bar is useful when there are a few (up to 3) main actions that
//! are desirable to be able to take quickly, literally with one press of a
//! button.
//!
//! <h3>More actions</h3>
//! If there are more than 3 actions the user might want to take:
//! * Try assigning the top and bottom icons of the action bar to the two most
//! immediate actions and use the middle icon to push a Window with a MenuLayer
//! with less immediate actions.
//! * Secondary actions that are not vital, can be "hidden" under a long click.
//! Try to group similar actions to one button. For example, in a Music app,
//! a single click on the top button is tied to the action to jump to the
//! previous track. Holding that same button means seek backwards.
//!
//! <h3>Directionality mapping</h3>
//! When the top and bottom buttons are used to control navigating through
//! a (potentially virtual, non-visible) list of items, follow this guideline:
//! * Tie the top button to the action that goes to the _previous_ item in the
//! list, for example "jump to previous track" in a Music app.
//! * Tie the bottom button to the action that goes to the _next_ item in the
//! list, for example "jump to next track" in a Music app.
//!

//! * The action bar is 20 pixels wide. Use the \ref ACTION_BAR_WIDTH define.
//! * The top and bottom spacing is 3 pixels each (the space between the top and
//! bottom of the frame of the action bar and the edges of the window it is
//! contained in).
//! * Icons should not be wider than 18 pixels. It is recommended to use a size
//! of around 14 x 14 pixels for the "visual core" of the icon, and extending
//! or contracting where needed.
//! <h3>Example Code</h3>
//! The code example below shows how to do the initial setup of the action bar
//! in a window's `.load` handler.
//! Configuring the button actions is similar to the process when using
//! \ref window_set_click_config_provider(). See \ref Clicks for more

//! \brief Layer that displays a bitmap image.
//!
//! ![](bitmap_layer.png)
//! BitmapLayer is a Layer subtype that draws a GBitmap within its frame. It uses an alignment property
//! to specify how to position the bitmap image with its frame. Optionally, when the
//! background color is not GColorClear, it draws a solid background color behind the
//! bitmap image, filling areas of the frame that are not covered by the bitmap image.
//! Lastly, using the compositing mode property of the BitmapLayer, determines the way the
//! bitmap image is drawn on top of what is underneath it (either the background color, or
//! the layers beneath it).
//!
//! <h3>Inside the Implementation</h3>
//! The implementation of BitmapLayer is fairly straightforward and relies heavily on the
//! functionality as exposed by the core drawing functions (see \ref Drawing).
//! \ref BitmapLayer's drawing callback uses \ref graphics_draw_bitmap_in_rect()
//! to perform the actual drawing of the \ref GBitmap. It uses \ref grect_align() to perform
//! the layout of the image and it uses \ref graphics_fill_rect() to draw the background plane.
