//! \brief Handling button click interactions
//!
//! Each Pebble window handles Pebble's buttons while it is displayed. Raw button down and button
//! up events are transformed into click events that can be transferred to your app:
//!
//! * Single-click. Detects a single click, that is, a button down event followed by a button up event.
//! It also offers hold-to-repeat functionality (repeated click).
//! * Multi-click. Detects double-clicking, triple-clicking and other arbitrary click counts.
//! It can fire its event handler on all of the matched clicks, or just the last.
//! * Long-click. Detects long clicks, that is, press-and-hold.
//! * Raw. Simply forwards the raw button events. It is provided as a way to use both the higher level
//! "clicks" processing and the raw button events at the same time.
//!
//! To receive click events when a window is displayed, you must register a \ref ClickConfigProvider for
//! this window with \ref window_set_click_config_provider(). Your \ref ClickConfigProvider will be called every time
//! the window becomes visible with one context argument. By default this context is a pointer to the window but you can
//! change this with \ref window_set_click_config_provider_with_context().
//!
//! In your \ref ClickConfigProvider you call the \ref window_single_click_subscribe(), \ref window_single_repeating_click_subscribe(),
//! \ref window_multi_click_subscribe(), \ref window_long_click_subscribe() and \ref window_raw_click_subscribe() functions to register
//! a handler for each event you wish to receive.
//!
//! For convenience, click handlers are provided with a \ref ClickRecognizerRef and a user-specified context.
//!
//! The \ref ClickRecognizerRef can be used in combination with \ref click_number_of_clicks_counted(), \ref
//! click_recognizer_get_button_id() and \ref click_recognizer_is_repeating() to get more information about the click. This is
//! useful if you want different buttons or event types to share the same handler.
//!
//! The user-specified context is the context of your \ref ClickConfigProvider (see above). By default it points to the window.
//! You can override it for all handlers with \ref window_set_click_config_provider_with_context() or for a specific button with \ref
//! window_set_click_context().
//!
//! <h3>User interaction in watchfaces</h3>
//! Watchfaces cannot use the buttons to interact with the user. Instead, you can use the \ref AccelerometerService.
//!
//! <h3>About the Back button</h3>
//! By default, the Back button will always pop to the previous window on the \ref WindowStack (and leave the app if the current
//! window is the only window). You can override the default back button behavior with \ref window_single_click_subscribe() and
//! \ref window_multi_click_subscribe() but you cannot set a repeating, long or raw click handler on the back button because a long press
//! will always terminate the app and return to the main menu.
//!
//! <h3>Usage example</h3>
//! First associate a click config provider callback with your window:
//! \code{.c}
//! void app_init(void) {
//!   ...
//!   window_set_click_config_provider(&window, (ClickConfigProvider) config_provider);
//!   ...
//! }
//! \endcode
//! Then in the callback, you set your desired configuration for each button:
//! \code{.c}
//! void config_provider(Window *window) {
//!  // single click / repeat-on-hold config:
//!   window_single_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_DOWN, down_single_click_handler);
//!   window_single_repeating_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_SELECT, 1000, select_single_click_handler);
//!
//!   // multi click config:
//!   window_multi_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_SELECT, 2, 10, 0, true, select_multi_click_handler);
//!
//!   // long click config:
//!   window_long_click_subscribe(BUTTON_ID_SELECT, 700, select_long_click_handler, select_long_click_release_handler);
//! }
//! \endcode
//! Now you implement the handlers for each click you've subscribed to and set up:
//! \code{.c}
//! void down_single_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called on single click ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context;
//! }
//! void select_single_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called on single click, and every 1000ms of being held ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context;
//! }
//!
//! void select_multi_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called for multi-clicks ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context;
//!   const uint16_t count = click_number_of_clicks_counted(recognizer);
//! }
//!
//! void select_long_click_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called on long click start ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context;
//! }
//!
//! void select_long_click_release_handler(ClickRecognizerRef recognizer, void *context) {
//!   ... called when long click is released ...
//!   Window *window = (Window *)context;
//! }
//! \endcode

//! @addtogroup CompassService
//!
//! \brief The Compass Service combines information from Pebble's accelerometer and magnetometer to automatically calibrate
//! the compass and transform the raw magnetic field information into a \ref CompassHeading, that is an angle to north.
//!
//! The Compass Service provides magnetic north and information about its status and accuracy through the \ref
//! CompassHeadingData structure. The API is designed to also provide true north in a future release.
//!
//! #### Calibration
//! The Compass Service requires an initial calibration before it can return accurate results. Calibration is
//! performed automatically by the system when required.
//! The `compass_status` field indicates whether the Compass Service is calibrating.
//! To help the calibration process, your application should
//! show a message to the user asking them to move their wrists in different directions.
//!
//! Refer to the compass examples for suggestions on how to implement this screen.
//!
//! #### Magnetic North and True North
//!
//! Depending on your location on earth, the measured heading towards magnetic north and
//! true north can significantly differ. This is called magnetic variation or declination.
//!
//! Pebble does not currently automatically correct the magnetic heading to return a true heading, but the API is designed so that
//! this feature can be added in the future and your applications will be able to automatically take advantage of it:
//!
//!  * If you need a precise heading in your application, we recommend that you use the `magnetic_heading` field and
//! use a webservice to retrieve the declination at your current location.
//!
//!  * If you choose to not correct the heading yourself, we recommend that you use the `true_heading` field. This field will contain
//! the magnetic heading if declination is not available, or the true heading if declination is available. The field
//! `is_declination_valid` will be true when declination is available. You can use this information to tell the user whether
//! you are showing magnetic north or true north.
//!
//! #### Battery Considerations
//! Using the compass will turn on both Pebble's magnetometer and accelerometer. Those two devices will have a slight
//! impact on battery life. A much more significant battery impact will be caused by redrawing the screen too often or
//! performing CPU-intensive work every time the compass heading is updated.
//!
//! We recommend that you follow the following best practices to optimize for battery life:
//!
//! * If your application is already rapidly redrawing the display, use \ref compass_service_peek() to get the most recent
//! available heading when drawing each frame.
//! * If your UI updates only when the heading changes, use \ref compass_service_subscribe() and set an appropriate filter to reduce
//! the number of events.
//! * If you use \ref compass_service_subscribe() and then do not require the compass heading anymore, remember to call
//! \ref compass_service_unsubscribe() to stop the Compass Service.
//! * Finally, note that every time you use \ref compass_service_peek(), the Compass Service will turn on and stay
//! active for a few seconds.
//!
//! #### Defining "up" on Pebble
//! Compass readings are always relative to the current orientation of Pebble. Using the accelerometer, the
//! Compass Service figures out what is the direction that the user is pointing at.
//!
//! If Pebble is held flat, the compass heading will be the angle between a vector to north and a vector going
//! from the bottom to the top of Pebble in a plane parallel to the screen (the Y axis vector of the accelerometer).
//! If the user lifts their arm so that Pebble is held vertical in front of them, compass heading will be relative to a vector
//! going through Pebble (opposite to the Z axis vector of the accelerometer). If the user keeps bringing their arm up,
//! effectively holding the Pebble upside down, the compass heading will be relative to a line from the top to the
//! bottom of Pebble, in the plane of the screen (opposite to the Y axis vector of the accelerometer).
//!

//! \brief Enables logging data asynchronously to a mobile app
//!
//! In Pebble OS, data logging is a data storage and transfer subsystem that allows watchapps to save
//! data on non-volatile storage devices when the phone is not available to process it. The API provides
//! your watchapp with a mechanism for short-term data buffering for asynchronous data transmission to
//! a mobile app.
//!
//! Using this API, your Pebble watchapp can create an arbitrary number of logs, but you’re limited in
//! the amount of storage space you can use. Note that approximately 640K is available for data
//! logging, which is shared among all watchapps that use it. This value is subject to change in the 
//! future. When the data spool is full, an app will start overwriting its own data. An app cannot 
//! overwrite another apps's data. However, the other app might have 0 bytes for data logging.
//!
//! Your app can log data to a session, either creating, adding or deleting data to that session.
//! The data is then sent to the associated phone application at the earliest convenience.
//! If a phone is available, the data is sent directly to the phone. Otherwise, it is saved to the
//! watch storage until the watch is connected to a phone.
//!
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! To create a data logging session for 4-byte unsigned integers with a tag of 0x1234, you would do this:
//! \code{.c}
//!
//! DataLoggingSessionRef logging_session = data_logging_create(0x1234, DATA_LOGGING_UINT, 4, false);
//!
//! // Fake creating some data and logging it to the session.
//! uint32_t data[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
//! data_logging_log(logging_session, &data, 4);
//!
//! // Fake creating more data and logging that as well.
//! uint32_t data2[] = { 1, 2 };
//! data_logging_log(logging_session, &data, 2);
//!
//! // When we don't need to log anything else, we can close off the session.
//! data_logging_finish(logging_session);
//! \endcode
//!
//! For code samples, refer to Examples/data-logging-demo.

//! \brief Data serialization utilities
//!
//!
//! Data residing in different parts of Pebble memory (RAM) may need to be gathered and assembled into
//! a single continuous block for transport over the network via Bluetooth. The process of gathering
//! and assembling this continuous block of data is called serialization.
//!
//! You use data serialization utilities, like Dictionary, Tuple and Tuplet data structures and accompanying
//! functions, to accomplish this task. No transformations are performed on the actual data, however.
//! These Pebble utilities simply help assemble the data into one continuous buffer according to a
//! specific format.
//!
//! \ref AppMessage uses these utilities--in particular, Dictionary--to send information between mobile
//! and Pebble watchapps.
//!
//! <h3>Writing key/value pairs</h3>
//! To write two key/value pairs, without using Tuplets, you would do this:
//! \code{.c}
//! // Byte array + key:
//! static const uint32_t SOME_DATA_KEY = 0xb00bf00b;
//! static const uint8_t data[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
//!
//! // CString + key:
//! static const uint32_t SOME_STRING_KEY = 0xabbababe;
//! static const char *string = "Hello World";
//!
//! // Calculate the buffer size that is needed for the final Dictionary:
//! const uint8_t key_count = 2;
//! const uint32_t size = dict_calc_buffer_size(key_count, sizeof(data),
//!                                             strlen(string) + 1);
//!
//! // Stack-allocated buffer in which to create the Dictionary:
//! uint8_t buffer[size];
//!
//! // Iterator variable, keeps the state of the creation serialization process:
//! DictionaryIterator iter;
//!
//! // Begin:
//! dict_write_begin(&iter, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
//! // Write the Data:
//! dict_write_data(&iter, SOME_DATA_KEY, data, sizeof(data));
//! // Write the CString:
//! dict_write_cstring(&iter, SOME_STRING_KEY, string);
//! // End:
//! const uint32_t final_size = dict_write_end(&iter);
//!
//! // buffer now contains the serialized information
//!
//! \endcode
//!
//! <h3>Reading key/value pairs</h3>
//! To iterate over the key/value pairs in the dictionary that
//! was created in the previous example code, you would do this:
//!
//! \code{.c}
//! Tuple *tuple = dict_read_begin_from_buffer(&iter, buffer, final_size);
//! while (tuple) {
//!   switch (tuple->key) {
//!     case SOME_DATA_KEY:
//!       foo(tuple->value->data, tuple->length);
//!       break;
//!     case SOME_STRING_KEY:
//!       bar(tuple->value->cstring);
//!       break;
//!   }
//!   tuple = dict_read_next(&iter);
//! }
//! \endcode
//!
//! <h3>Tuple and Tuplet data structures</h3>
//! To understand the difference between Tuple and Tuplet data structures:
//! Tuple is the header for a serialized key/value pair, while Tuplet is a helper
//! data structure that references the value you want to serialize. This data
//! structure exists to make the creation of a Dictionary easier to write.
//! Use this mnemonic to remember the difference: TupleT(emplate), the Tuplet being
//! a template to create a Dictionary with Tuple structures.
//!
//! For example:
//! \code{.c}
//! Tuplet pairs[] = {
//!   TupletInteger(WEATHER_ICON_KEY, (uint8_t) 1),
//!   TupletCString(WEATHER_TEMPERATURE_KEY, "1234 Fahrenheit"),
//! };
//! uint8_t buffer[256];
//! uint32_t size = sizeof(buffer);
//! dict_serialize_tuplets_to_buffer(pairs, ARRAY_LENGTH(pairs), buffer, &size);
//!
//! // buffer now contains the serialized information
//! \endcode

//!
//! \brief Bi-directional communication between phone apps and Pebble watchapps
//!
//! AppMessage is a bi-directional messaging subsystem that enables communication between phone apps
//! and Pebble watchapps. This is accomplished by allowing phone and watchapps to exchange arbitrary
//! sets of key/value pairs. The key/value pairs are stored in the form of a Dictionary, the layout
//! of which is left for the application developer to define.
//!
//! AppMessage implements a push-oriented messaging protocol, enabling your app to call functions and
//! methods to push messages from Pebble to phone and vice versa. The protocol is symmetric: both Pebble
//! and the phone can send messages. All messages are acknowledged. In this context, there is no
//! client-server model, as such.
//!
//! During the sending phase, one side initiates the communication by transferring a dictionary over the air.
//! The other side then receives this message and is given an opportunity to perform actions on that data.
//! As soon as possible, the other side is expected to reply to the message with a simple acknowledgment
//! that the message was received successfully.
//!
//! PebbleKit JavaScript provides you with a set of standard JavaScript APIs that let your app receive messages
//! from the watch, make HTTP requests, and send new messages to the watch. AppMessage APIs are used to send and
//! receive data. A Pebble watchapp can use the resources of the connected phone to fetch information from web services,
//! send information to web APIs, or store login credentials. On the JavaScript side, you communicate
//! with Pebble via a Pebble object exposed in the namespace.
//!
//! Messages always need to get either ACKnowledged or "NACK'ed," that is, not acknowledged.
//! If not, messages will result in a time-out failure. The AppMessage subsystem takes care of this implicitly.
//! In the phone libraries, this step is a bit more explicit.
//!
//! The Pebble watch interfaces make a distinction between the Inbox and the Outbox calls. The Inbox
//! receives messages from the phone on the watch; the Outbox sends messages from the watch to the phone.
//! These two buffers can be managed separately.
//!
//! <h4>Warning</h4>
//! A critical constraint of AppMessage is that messages are limited in size. An ingoing (outgoing) message
//! larger than the inbox (outbox) will not be transmitted and will generate an error. You can choose your
//! inbox and outbox size when you call app_message_open().
//!
//! Pebble SDK provides a static minimum guaranteed size (APP_MESSAGE_INBOX_SIZE_MINIMUM and APP_MESSAGE_OUTBOX_SIZE_MINIMUM).
//! Requesting a buffer of the minimum guaranteed size (or smaller) is always guaranteed to succeed on all
//! Pebbles in this SDK version or higher, and with every phone.
//!
//! In some context, Pebble might be able to provide your application with larger inbox/outbox.
//! You can call app_message_inbox_size_maximum() and app_message_outbox_size_maximum() in your code to get
//! the largest possible value you can use.
//!
//! To always get the largest buffer available, follow this best practice:
//!
//! app_message_open(app_message_inbox_size_maximum(), app_message_outbox_size_maximum())
//!
//! AppMessage uses your application heap space. That means that the sizes you pick for the AppMessage
//! inbox and outbox buffers are important in optimizing your app’s performance. The more you use for
//! AppMessage, the less space you’ll have for the rest of your app.
//!
//! To register callbacks, you should call app_message_register_inbox_received(), app_message_register_inbox_dropped(),
//! app_message_register_outbox_sent(), app_message_register_outbox_failed().
//!
//! Pebble recommends that you call them before app_message_open() to ensure you do not miss a message
//! arriving between starting AppMessage and registering the callback. You can set a context that will be passed
//! to all the callbacks with app_message_set_context().
//!
//! In circumstances that may not be ideal, when using AppMessage several types of errors may occur.
//! For example:
//!
//! * The send can’t start because the system state won't allow for a success. Several reasons
//!  you're unable to perform a send: A send() is already occurring (only one is possible at a time) or Bluetooth
//!  is not enabled or connected.
//! * The send and receive occur, but the receiver can’t accept the message. For instance, there is no app
//!   that receives such a message.
//! * The send occurs, but the receiver either does not actually receive the message or can’t handle it
//!   in a timely fashion.
//! * In the case of a dropped message, the phone sends a message to the watchapp, while there is still
//!   an unprocessed message in the Inbox.
//!
//! Other errors are possible and described by AppMessageResult. A client of the AppMessage interface
//! should use the result codes to be more robust in the face of communication problems either in the field or while debugging.
//!
//! Refer to the \htmlinclude app-phone-communication.html for a conceptual overview and code usage.
//!

//! \brief UI synchronization layer for AppMessage
//!
//! AppSync is a convenience layer that resides on top of \ref AppMessage, and serves
//! as a UI synchronization layer for AppMessage. In so doing, AppSync makes it easier
//! to drive the information displayed in the watchapp UI with messages sent by a phone app.
//!
//! AppSync maintains and updates a Dictionary, and provides your app with a callback
//! (AppSyncTupleChangedCallback) routine that is called whenever the Dictionary changes
//! and the app's UI is updated. Note that the app UI is not updated automatically.
//! To update the UI, you need to implement the callback.
//!
//! Pebble OS provides support for data serialization utilities, like Dictionary,
//! Tuple and Tuplet data structures and their accompanying functions. You use Tuplets to create
//! a Dictionary with Tuple structures.
//!
//! AppSync manages the storage and bookkeeping chores of the current Tuple values. AppSync copies
//! incoming AppMessage Tuples into this "current" Dictionary, so that the key/values remain available
//! for the UI to use. For example, it is safe to use a C-string value provided by AppSync and use it
//! directly in a text_layer_set_text() call.
//!
//! Your app needs to supply the buffer that AppSync uses for the "current" Dictionary when initializing AppSync.
//!
//! Refer to the \htmlinclude app-phone-communication.html for a conceptual overview and code usage.
//! @{

//! Called whenever a Tuple changes. This does not necessarily mean the value in
//! the Tuple has changed. When the internal "current" dictionary gets updated,
//! existing Tuples might get shuffled around in the backing buffer, even though
//! the values stay the same. In this callback, the client code gets the chance
//! to remove the old reference and start using the new one.
//! In this callback, your application MUST clean up any references to the
//! `old_tuple` of a PREVIOUS call to this callback (and replace it with the
//! `new_tuple` that is passed in with the current call).
//! @param key The key for which the Tuple was changed.
//! @param new_tuple The new tuple. The tuple points to the actual, updated

//! \brief A mechanism to store persistent application data and state

//! The Persistent Storage API provides you with a mechanism for performing a variety of tasks,
//! like saving user settings, caching data from the phone app, or counting high scores for
//! Pebble watchapp games.
//!
//! In Pebble OS, storage is defined by a collection of fields that you can create, modify or delete.
//! In the API, a field is specified as a key with a corresponding value.
//!
//! Using the Storage API, every app is able to get its own persistent storage space. Each value
//! in that space is associated with a uint32_t key.
//!
//! Storage supports saving integers, strings and byte arrays. The maximum size of byte arrays and
//! strings is defined by PERSIST_DATA_MAX_LENGTH (currently set to 256 bytes). You call the function
//! persist_exists(key), which returns a boolean indicating if the key exists or not.
//! The Storage API enables your app to save its state, and when compared to using \ref AppMessage to
//! retrieve values from the phone, it provides you with a much faster way to restore state.
//! In addition, it draws less power from the battery.
//!
//! Note that the size of all persisted values cannot exceed 4K.

//! \brief The "canvas" into which an application draws
//!
//! The Pebble OS graphics engine, inspired by several notable graphics systems, including
//! Apple’s Quartz 2D and its predecessor QuickDraw, provides your app with a canvas into
//! which to draw, namely, the graphics context. A graphics context is the target into which
//! graphics functions can paint, using Pebble drawing routines (see \ref Drawing,
//! \ref PathDrawing and \ref TextDrawing).
//!
//! A graphics context holds a reference to the bitmap into which to paint. It also holds the
//! current drawing state, like the current fill color, stroke color, clipping box, drawing box,
//! compositing mode, and so on. The GContext struct is the type representing the graphics context.
//!
//! For drawing in your Pebble watchface or watchapp, you won't need to create a GContext
//! yourself. In most cases, it is provided by Pebble OS as an argument passed into a render
//! callback (the .update_proc of a Layer).
//!
//! Your app can’t call drawing functions at any given point in time: Pebble OS will request your
//! app to render. Typically, your app will be calling out to graphics functions in
//! the .update_proc callback of a Layer.

//! @addtogroup Layer Layers
//! \brief User interface layers for displaying graphic components
//!
//! Layers are objects that can be displayed on a Pebble watchapp window, enabling users to see
//! visual objects, like text or images. Each layer stores the information about its state
//! necessary to draw or redraw the object that it represents and uses graphics routines along with
//! this state to draw itself when asked. Layers can be used to display various graphics.
//!
//! Layers are the basic building blocks for your application UI. Layers can be nested inside each other.
//! Every window has a root layer which is always the topmost layer.
//! You provide a function that is called to draw the content of the layer when needed; or
//! you can use standard layers that are provided by the system, such as text layer, image layer,
//! menu layer, action bar layer, and so on.
//!
//! The Pebble layer hierarchy is the list of things that need to be drawn to the screen.
//! Multiple layers can be arranged into a hierarchy. This enables ordering (front to back),
//! layout and hierarchy. Through relative positioning, visual objects that are grouped together by
//! adding them into the same layer can be moved all at once. This means that the child layers
//! will move accordingly. If a parent layer has clipping enabled, all the children will be clipped
//! to the frame of the parent.
//!
//! Pebble OS provides convenience layers with built-in logic for displaying different graphic
//! components, like text and bitmap layers.
//!
//! Refer to the \htmlinclude UiFramework.html (chapter "Layers") for a conceptual overview
//! of Layers and relevant code examples.
//!
//! The Modules listed here contain what can be thought of conceptually as subclasses of Layer. The
//! listed types can be safely type-casted to `Layer` (or `Layer *` in case of a pointer).
//! The `layer_...` functions can then be used with the data structures of these subclasses.
//! <br/>For example, the following is legal:
//! \code{.c}
//! TextLayer *text_layer;
//! ...
//! layer_set_hidden((Layer *)text_layer, true);
//! \endcode

//! @addtogroup Window
//! \brief The basic building block of the user interface
//!
//! Windows are the top-level elements in the UI hierarchy and the basic building blocks for a Pebble
//! UI. A single window is always displayed at a time on Pebble, with the exception of when animating
//! from one window to the other, which, in that case, is managed by the window stack. You can stack
//! windows on top of each other, but only the topmost window will be visible.
//!
//! Users wearing a Pebble typically interact with the content and media displayed in a window, clicking
//! and pressing buttons on the watch, depending on what they see and wish to respond to in a window.
//!
//! Windows serve to display a hierarchy of layers on the screen and handle user input. When a window is
//! visible, its root Layer (and all its child layers) are drawn onto the screen automatically.
//!
//! You need a window, which always fills the entire screen, to display images, text, and graphics in
//! your Pebble app. A layer by itself doesn’t display on Pebble; it must be in the current window’s
//! layer hierarchy to be visible.
//!
//! The Window Stack serves as the global manager of what window is presented and makes sure that input
//! events are forwarded to the topmost window.
//!
//! Refer to the \htmlinclude UiFramework.html (chapter "Window") for a conceptual
//! overview of Window, the Window Stack and relevant code examples.

//!               window, but also when the window is pushed for the first time. This is a

//! @addtogroup WindowStack Window Stack
//! \brief The multiple window manager
//!
//! In Pebble OS, the window stack serves as the global manager of what window is presented,
//! ensuring that input events are forwarded to the topmost window.
//! The navigation model of Pebble centers on the concept of a vertical “stack” of windows, similar
//! to mobile app interactions.
//!
//! In working with the Window Stack API, the basic operations include push and pop. When an app wants to
//! display a new window, it pushes a new window onto the stack. This appears like a window sliding in
//! from the right. As an app is closed, the window is popped off the stack and disappears.
//!
//! For more complicated operations, involving multiple windows, you can determine which windows reside
//! on the stack, using window_stack_contains_window() and remove any specific window, using window_stack_remove().
//!
//! Refer to the \htmlinclude UiFramework.html (chapter "Window Stack") for a conceptual overview
//! of the window stack and relevant code examples.
//!
//! Also see the \ref WindowHandlers of a \ref Window for the callbacks that can be added to a window
//! in order to act upon window stack transitions.

//! \brief Concrete animations to move a layer around over time
//!
//! Actually, property animations do more than just moving a Layer around over time.
//! PropertyAnimation is a concrete class of animations and is built around the Animation subsystem,
//! which covers anything timing related, but does not move anything around.
//! A ProperyAnimation animates a "property" of a "subject".
//!
//! <h3>Animating a Layer's frame property</h3>
//! Currently there is only one specific type of property animation offered off-the-shelf, namely
//! one to change the frame (property) of a layer (subject), see \ref property_animation_create_layer_frame().
//!
//! <h3>Implementing a custom PropertyAnimation</h3>
//! It is fairly simple to create your own variant of a PropertyAnimation.
//!
//! Please refer to \htmlinclude UiFramework.html (chapter "Property Animations") for a conceptual overview
//! of the animation framework and make sure you understand the underlying \ref Animation, in case you are
//! not familiar with it, before trying to implement a variation on PropertyAnimation.
//!
//! To implement a custom property animation, use \ref property_animation_create() and provide a function
//! pointers to the accessors (getter and setter) and setup, update and teardown callbacks in the implementation argument.
//! Note that the type of property to animate with \ref PropertyAnimation is limited to int16_t, GPoint or GRect.
//!
//! For each of these types, there are implementations provided
//! for the necessary `.update` handler of the animation: see \ref property_animation_update_int16(),
//! \ref property_animation_update_gpoint() and \ref property_animation_update_grect().
//! These update functions expect the `.accessors` to conform to the following interface:
//! Any getter needs to have the following function signature: `__type__ getter(void *subject);`
//! Any setter needs to have to following function signature: `void setter(void *subject, __type__ value);`
//! See \ref Int16Getter, \ref Int16Setter, \ref GPointGetter, \ref GPointSetter, \ref GRectGetter, \ref GRectSetter
//! for the typedefs that accompany the update fuctions.

//! * Shadows to indicate that there is more content are automatically drawn
//! on top of the content. When the end of the scroll layer is reached, the
//! shadow will automatically be retracted.
//! * Scrolling from one offset to another is animated implicitly by default.
//! * The scroll layer contains a "content" sub-layer, which is the layer that
//! is actually moved up an down. Any layer that is a child of this "content"
//! sub-layer, will be moved as well. Effectively, an entire layout of layers
//! can be scrolled this way. Use the convenience function
//! \ref scroll_layer_add_child() to add child layers to the "content" sub-layer.
//! * The scroll layer needs to be informed of the total size of the contents,
//! in order to calculate from and to what point it should be able to scroll.
//! Use \ref scroll_layer_set_content_size() to set the size of the contents.
//! * The button behavior is set up, using the convenience function
//! \ref scroll_layer_set_click_config_onto_window(). This will associate the
//! UP and DOWN buttons with scrolling up and down.
//! * The SELECT button can be configured by installing a click configuration
//! provider using \ref scroll_layer_set_callbacks().
//! * To scroll programatically to a certain offset, use
//! \ref scroll_layer_set_content_offset().
//! * It is possible to get called back for each scrolling increment, by
//! installing the `.content_offset_changed_handler` callback using
//! \ref scroll_layer_set_callbacks().
//! * Only vertical scrolling is supported at the moment.

//! * All data needed to render the menu is requested on-demand via callbacks,
//! to avoid the need to keep a lot of data in memory.
//! * Support for "sections". A section is a group of items, visually separated
//! by a header with the name at the top of the section.
//! * Variable heights: each menu item cell and each section header can have
//! its own height. The heights are provided by callbacks.
//! * Deviation from the Layer system for cell drawing: Each menu item does
//! _not_ have its own Layer (to minimize memory usage). Instead, a
//! drawing callback is set onto the MenuLayer that is responsible
//! for drawing each menu item. The menu layer will call this callback for each
//! menu item that is visible and needs to be rendered.
//! * Cell and header drawing can be customized by implementing a custom drawing
//! callback.
//! * A few "canned" menu cell drawing functions are provided for convenience,
//! which support the default menu cell layout with a title, optional subtitle
//! and icon.

//! \brief Vertical, bar-shaped control widget on the right edge of the window
//!
//! ![](action_bar_layer.png)
//! ActionBarLayer is a Layer that displays a bar on the right edge of the
//! window. The bar can contain up to 3 icons, each corresponding with one of
//! the buttons on the right side of the watch. The purpose of each icon is
//! to provide a hint (feed-forward) to what action a click on the respective
//! button will cause.
//!
//! The action bar is useful when there are a few (up to 3) main actions that
//! are desirable to be able to take quickly, literally with one press of a
//! button.
//!
//! <h3>More actions</h3>
//! If there are more than 3 actions the user might want to take:
//! * Try assigning the top and bottom icons of the action bar to the two most
//! immediate actions and use the middle icon to push a Window with a MenuLayer
//! with less immediate actions.
//! * Secondary actions that are not vital, can be "hidden" under a long click.
//! Try to group similar actions to one button. For example, in a Music app,
//! a single click on the top button is tied to the action to jump to the
//! previous track. Holding that same button means seek backwards.
//!
//! <h3>Directionality mapping</h3>
//! When the top and bottom buttons are used to control navigating through
//! a (potentially virtual, non-visible) list of items, follow this guideline:
//! * Tie the top button to the action that goes to the _previous_ item in the
//! list, for example "jump to previous track" in a Music app.
//! * Tie the bottom button to the action that goes to the _next_ item in the
//! list, for example "jump to next track" in a Music app.
//!
//! <h3>Geometry</h3>
//! * The action bar is 20 pixels wide. Use the \ref ACTION_BAR_WIDTH define.
//! * The top and bottom spacing is 3 pixels each (the space between the top and
//! bottom of the frame of the action bar and the edges of the window it is
//! contained in).
//! * Icons should not be wider than 18 pixels. It is recommended to use a size
//! of around 14 x 14 pixels for the "visual core" of the icon, and extending
//! or contracting where needed.
//! <h3>Example Code</h3>
//! The code example below shows how to do the initial setup of the action bar
//! in a window's `.load` handler.
//! Configuring the button actions is similar to the process when using
//! \ref window_set_click_config_provider(). See \ref Clicks for more
//! information.

//!
//! <h3>Inside the Implementation</h3>
//! The implementation of BitmapLayer is fairly straightforward and relies heavily on the
//! functionality as exposed by the core drawing functions (see \ref Drawing).
//! \ref BitmapLayer's drawing callback uses \ref graphics_draw_bitmap_in_rect()
//! to perform the actual drawing of the \ref GBitmap. It uses \ref grect_align() to perform
//! the layout of the image and it uses \ref graphics_fill_rect() to draw the background plane.

//! \brief Layer that displays a rotated bitmap image.
//!
//! A RotBitmapLayer is like a \ref BitmapLayer but has the ability to be rotated (by default, around its center). The amount of rotation
//! is specified using \ref rot_bitmap_layer_set_angle() or \ref rot_bitmap_layer_increment_angle(). The rotation argument
//! to those functions is specified as an amount of clockwise rotation, where the value 0x10000 represents a full 360 degree
//! rotation and 0 represent no rotation, and it scales linearly between those values, just like \ref sin_lookup.
//!
//! The center of rotation in the source bitmap is always placed at the center of the RotBitmapLayer and the size of the RotBitmapLayer
//! is automatically calculated so that the entire Bitmap can fit in at all rotation angles.
//!
//! For example, if the image is 10px wide and high, the RotBitmapLayer will be 14px wide ( sqrt(10^2+10^2) ).
//!
//! By default, the center of rotation in the source bitmap is the center of the bitmap but you can call \ref rot_bitmap_set_src_ic() to change the
//! center of rotation.
