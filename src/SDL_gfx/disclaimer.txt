These source files are based of the SDL_gfx library written by Andreas Schiffler and 
originally stand under the license text you find in every source file.
To be compatible with SDL2 (and still using surfaces instead of renderer/texture )
I modified following files:

1. SDL_gfxBlitFunc.c
2. SDL_rotozoom.c
3. SDL_gfxPrimitives.c

All changes should have been marked with a comment starting with "Helco"
To achieve a full compatibility this modified version of SDL_gfx stands under the same
license as its base
