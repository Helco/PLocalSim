[Installation]
1. Copy the content of the directory ./build/linux/build/ into your pebble sdk directory 
   (e.g. /home/helco/pebble/PebbleSDK-2.0/) It will not overwrite any original files. 
2. It may be that you have to install some SDL libraries if you haven't done this before.
   On ubuntu this requires one simple command:
	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

[Use]
To build your app, switch (in the terminal) to your project's main directory and run
	build.local.sh
This will build your application, compile your resources and put all files necessary to run
your application in the directory <project>/build/local/ .You can run it from there or simply
type:
	run.local.sh
which will run it for you.

[Debugging]
If you see the need you can add the flag '--debug' to build.local.sh or run.local.sh
to build your project with debugging symbols and run it in gdb.

[Build the project on your own]
To build the project on your own, there are two codeblocks projects in the directory
./build/linux/codeblocks
