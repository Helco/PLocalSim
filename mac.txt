[THE MAC SDK IS NOT READY YET]


[Installation]-----------------------------------------------------------

Install SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_image with homebrew, use `--universal` to get 32 bit support.

  % brew install SDL SDL_ttf SDL_image --universal


[Use]--------------------------------------------------------------------

In build/mac there is a pre-built `sim.zip` package ready to be used.

Unzip and place the sim directory in your pebble project. 

Open Terminal.app and cd into it

  % make

It should compile all `.c` files in src.

Hopefully you will get a PebbleSim binary you can run from the terminal with

  % ./PebbleSim

Good luck!

[Debugging]--------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps for normal use but build and run with the following commands:

  % make debuge

It should compile all `.c` files in src with debugging enabled.

Run the debug simulator in gdb:

  % gdb ./PebbleSim.debug

[Build the project on your own]------------------------------------------

Open Terminal.app and cd into `build/mac`

  % make

Hopefully you now have a sim directory ready to be used as described above.
